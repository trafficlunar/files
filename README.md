## how to use
### uploading
To upload a file or multiple files, make a POST request to the `/api/upload` route with the file(s) attached with the header `Authorization` with its value set to the password. The server will write the file using its original filename as sent in the request, not the field name.

Example response:
```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "name": "file_name",
      "url": "file_url"
    },
    {
      "name": "file_name",
      "url": "file_url"
    }
  ],
  "success": true
}
```

### deleting
To delete a file, make a DELETE request to `/api/delete` with the `Authorization` header and set the body to the JSON example below:
```json
{
    "name": "file_name_here"
}
```

### renaming
To rename a file, do the same request as deleting but instead to the route `/api/rename` with the method PUT and set the body to the JSON example below:
```json
{
    "name": "file_name_here",
    "new_name": "new_file_name_here"
}
```

### view all uploads (directory)
To view all the uploads (also known as the directory), go to `/` and enter the optional password. You can also delete and rename files and also upload on this page.

There is also an option to do this in JSON form, to do this, create a GET request to `/api/uploads` which will return every file uploaded in a JSON string array. The `Authorization` header may be required if `PROTECT_DIRECTORY` is enabled in .env.

### previewing files
There is two ways to view a specific file - you can either go to the URL with all the fancy styling which is `/file_name_here` or go to the same URL but with `/raw` and only the file itself at the end like `/file_name_here/raw`

### viewing information of a file
To view information of a file (name, size, modified time, url), create a GET request to `/file_name_here/info` like you would do above but with `/info` as the suffix. This does not require authorization.

## installing
### docker (recommended)
You can either build the image manually or pull it from ghcr.io.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/trafficlunar/files
$ cd files
# (optional) change favicon.ico to whatever you want
$ docker build -t files .
```

```bash
$ docker pull ghcr.io/trafficlunar/files:latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> Read [.env.example](https://github.com/trafficlunar/files/blob/master/.env.example) for more information on these variables.

```bash
docker run -d \
    --restart=always \
    -e BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000" \
    -e PAGE_TITLE="files" \
    -e PASSWORD="" \
    -e PROTECT_DIRECTORY=true \
    -e ENABLE_FILE_ACTIONS_DIRECTORY=true \
    -e GENERATE_PASSWORD=true \
    -e GENERATE_PASSWORD_LENGTH=16 \
    -e GENERATE_FILENAME=false \
    -e GENERATE_FILENAME_LENGTH=8 \
    -e METRICS_ENABLED=true \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    -p 3001:3001 \
    -v /path/to/uploads/:/app/uploads/ \
    --name files \
    ghcr.io/trafficlunar/files:latest # or files:latest
```

### manually
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trafficlunar/files
cd files
```

2. Rename `.env.preview` to `.env` and edit to your liking
3. (optional) Change the `favicon.ico` to whatever you want
4. Build and run the server
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/files
```
